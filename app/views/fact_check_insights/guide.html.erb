			<p class="b2">ClaimReview <%= link_to "is a tagging system", "http://schema.org/ClaimReview" %> that publishers use to flag fact-check articles for search engines, apps and social media platforms. It identifies key elements of fact-checks for platforms such as Google, Bing, and Facebook. ClaimReview also summarizes a fact-check, noting the person and claim being checked and a conclusion about its accuracy. Because of this, it has become a source of important data that can be used by researchers, academics and others interested in the work of fact-checkers.</p>

			<p class="b2">Fact-checkers at organizations all over the world enter ClaimReview data every time they publish a fact-check.

			<p class="b2">The Lab tracks hundreds of nonpartisan organizations that regularly publish articles, videos or audio reports that verify claims made by politicians, debunk social media rumors and hoaxes, and/or review political promises made by candidates or parties. <%= link_to "Visit the Reporters’ Lab site", "https://reporterslab.org/how-we-identify-fact-checkers/" %> for more information on how we determine which organizations to include.

		<h2 class="mb-10 lg:mb-20">A few things we’ve learned about working with this data:</h2>
		<ul class="tips">
			<li class="tip">
				<h3 class="h4">Check names</h3>
				<p>Most fields in ClaimReview and MediaReview are entered by fact-checkers as free text. This means you may need to standardize references to, for example, “Joe Biden” versus “Joseph Biden.”</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tip">
				<h3 class="h4">Rate the ratings</h3>
				<p>Fact-checkers choose their own rating systems for ClaimReview, which means standardization can be challenging. Some also use numerical ratings, on a scale of 1 to 10, but since they define their own scale, those ratings are also not standardized.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tip">
				<h3 class="h4">A ratings exception</h3>
				<p>Fact-checkers do use standard ratings for MediaReview, when describing if a fact-checked image, video, audio or meme has been manipulated, and if so, how. Those ratings include “Missing Context,” “Edited,” “Satire/Parody,” and more.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tip">
				<h3 class="h4">Duplicates Duplicates</h3>
				<p>You may find accidental repeats of ClaimReview entries — but sometimes duplicates occur on purpose, such as when a fact-checking organization does a roundup of several claims from the same event or politician.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tip">
				<h3 class="h4">Language matters</h3>
				<p>Some fact-checking organizations publish in multiple languages, so you may find the same content translated into multiple entries.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tip">
				<h3 class="h4">Watch for dates</h3>
				<p>While most dates are entered using a selector, you may encounter mix-ups due to human error and the international nature of the data — the most common example is the digit of the day and month being accidentally swapped.</p>
