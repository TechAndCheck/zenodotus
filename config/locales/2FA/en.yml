    security_requirement: "For security purposes we require two-factor authentication on all accounts. This ensures that even if your password is compromised your data is secure from attackers trying to log into your account."
    webauthn_explanation: "We use a method of authentication known as Webauthn that will use your device/browser to create a passkey to identify you. Once you begin the process, your system will guide you through the necessary steps. After setup, you can return to the Settings page from your Fact-Check Insights account to add keys for additional devices."
