    what_is_mediavault: "What is MediaVault?"
    mediavault_is_an_unprecedented_archive: "MediaVault is an unprecedented archive of images, videos and memes that have been analyzed by reputable fact-checking organizations from around the world."
    our_cutting_edge_system_scrapes: "Our cutting-edge system scrapes and stores content from social media platforms and other sources that would otherwise disappear completely if it is deleted or removed. With MediaVault, fact-checkers can preserve the content that they have fact-checked in its original form. That content then becomes searchable, so other fact-checkers can easily determine if a given image or video has been fact-checked before."
    mediavault_provides_long_term_accessibility: "MediaVault provides long-term accessibility and durability for archiving, research and more rapid detection of misleading images and video."
    what_descriptive_data_is_included_with_mediavault_entries: "What descriptive data is included with MediaVault entries?"
    mediavault_entries_are_collected: "MediaVault entries are collected when fact-checkers use a tagging system known as MediaReview that allows them to identify whether a video, image, or meme has been manipulated. Fact-checkers provide basic information — for example, the URL where the piece of media was found, and the URL of their fact-checking article — as well as an assessment of whether the media was manipulated. (For more on these assessments, see “How do fact-checkers assess MediaVault content?” below.)"
    along_with_the_mediareview: "Along with the MediaReview tagging data, most MediaVault entries also contain data from ClaimReview, a sibling to MediaReview used by fact-checkers to rate claims regardless of format. ClaimReview includes information about the statement being checked, the source of the claim, the location, the date, the conclusion the fact-checker reached about the statement’s veracity, and more."
