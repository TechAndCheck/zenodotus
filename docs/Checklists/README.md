# Checklists Overview

To better manage our system we have series of checklists that are designed to make sure nothing is missed when adding a new feature or adjusting major abilities. They are designed to act as a second set of eyes since our dev team is currently just Chris. Follow these, strictly, don't skip a step.

## Adding a new checklist
- [] Follow the template provided
- [] Write initial steps as you think it should be done
- [] Follow the steps you wrote to sanity check it
- [] If something is missing add it to the list and try again
- [] Say the steps out loud as your doing this, it helps (seriously)
- [] Add the name of the new checklist to the listing below this document

## Modifying a checklist
- [] Create a branch for the new elements
- [] Make the changes your prefer
- [] As with making a new checklist, follow them exactly to test
- [] Create a pull request explaining why you're adding the new feature.

## List of Checklists
- [] Adding a new domain type
