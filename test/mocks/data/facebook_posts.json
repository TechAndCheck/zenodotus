As wildfire season grows each year, so does the need for more friendly furry faces like Kerith’s. Kerith and her human, Heidi C., spend their days visiting wildfire base camps, emergency call centers, hospitals and other high-stress work environments where hugging a happy dog is often the only way that those on the ground can process the intense grief and trauma often present in their work. They’ve visited some of the biggest fires in recent history, like the Dixie Fire, the Caldor Fire, and the Windy Fire inside the Sequoia National Forest.\n\nHeidi founded her non-profit, First Responder Therapy Dogs, in January after visiting firefighters battling the Woodward Fire in Marin County last year. Since January, First Responder Therapy Dogs has grown to include teams in six states who primarily use Instagram Direct Messages to coordinate site visits. Each team volunteers its efforts, so Heidi often turns to Instagram and Facebook to raise funds for their work. “Starting a nonprofit in a pandemic has been challenging,” Heidi says. “[But] it's really rewarding because those guys are so stressed out. I feel so grateful and honored to be able to go into these places and see what's happening behind the scenes.\"",
